  ────────────────────────
  Barangay: [barangay]

```

### 6. **Mock Data** (`src/App.tsx`)

Updated sample reports with example location data:

**Report 1:**
- Barangay: San Jose
- Purok: Mahogany

**Report 2:**
- Barangay: Liwanag
- Purok: Bayview

## User Workflow

### 1. **Profile Setup**
User registers and completes profile:
1. User edits their profile
2. Enters Barangay, Purok, and Street information
3. Saves profile
4. Information is persisted in local storage

### 2. **Report Creation**
When creating a report:
1. Location fields are pre-populated from user profile
2. User can modify or add specific location details for the report
3. Location details are included when report is submitted
4. Report is saved with all location information

### 3. **Admin Dashboard**
Staff viewing reports:
1. Opens report details in Staff Dashboard
2. Sees full location information including:
   - Main location address
   - Coordinates (if available)
   - Barangay
   - Purok
   - Street
3. Can use this for better report organization and response
